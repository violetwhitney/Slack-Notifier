# Slack-Notifier
Grasshopper Script Posts to Slack

This Grasshopper Script uses GUIDs from Rhino to post new Channels to slack. The code creates a custom Slack account for a Rhino 3D model
to track all conversations by their associated GUID. This was created for Dan Taeyoung's Metatool course at Columbia University GSAPP. See Dan's work here: http://dantaeyoung.com/
